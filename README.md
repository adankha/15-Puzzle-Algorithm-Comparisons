# 15_Puzzle_Multiple_Search_Algorithms
The following program solves 15 puzzle boards in multiple ways and compares the run-time and space complexity of each search. 
Searches used: 
Breadth First Search (BFS)
Iterative Deepending DFS (IDDFS) (Both done recursively and iteratively)
A* Using the Manhattan Heuristic

Each search has its own file in which I take a slightly different approach in code structure.

The program was created using Python 3.6
